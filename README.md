# Python-Serial-Communication-Thread
This small project provides a threaded implementation for serial communication, designed to facilitate efficient data exchange with serial devices. The main feature of this implementation is the use of threads to concurrently handle serial communication while allowing the main program to perform other tasks simultaneously. 

Before running this project, check which COM your USB port is being set on. This can be checked through Device Manager.
